This is Rubber.

Rubber is a building system for LaTeX documents. It is based on a routine that
runs just as many compilations as necessary and runs companion programs like
BibTeX and Makeindex when needed. The module system provides a great
flexibility that virtually allows support for any package with no user
intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the document. A good
number of standard packages are supported, including graphics/graphicx with
automatic conversion between various graphics formats and Metapost
compilation. The associated tool "rubber-info" extracts information, such as
dependency relations or post-compilation diagnostics.


* Installation

Running Rubber just requires Python version 2.6 or newer.  Of course it won't
be of much use without a working LaTeX environment (Rubber is known to work on
TeXLive and VTeX on various flavors of Unix including Darwin and Cygwin, any
feedback is welcome about other systems).

For compilation, you will need the Python Distutils, which are usually included
in development packages (in Debian, this is the python-dev package).  To build
the documentation, you need texinfo (Debian package: texinfo).

To compile and install Rubber, just follow the usual procedure:

# python2 setup.py --help
# python2 setup.py install
# python2 setup.py clean --all

Some options affect other commands indirectly:
* moddir is used to generate src/version.py and must be set at build time.
* Only documentation formats selected during build are installed.
If you need to build and install as separate steps, for example in
order to select a --root stage directory during install, you should
set these options in the configuration file setup.cfg, and then invoke

# python2 setup.py build
# python2 setup.py install --root=stage_dir


* Usage

As civility requires, saying `rubber --help' and `rubber-info --help' provides
a short description of the command line's syntax. The included manual pages
(available in English and French) and Texinfo documentation contain more
precise usage information.
